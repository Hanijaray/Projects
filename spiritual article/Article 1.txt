	<h1>Hello Angels Welcome To Our Page!</h1>
	<h2>What do you think about lord shiva?</h2>
	<p>We all know lord shiva doesn't born as a baby,because there is no such vedas or sastras told shiva was born as a baby</p>
	<h3>Then how shiva came to Earth?</h3>
	<h3>y'all eager to know the answer?</h3>
	</article>
	<article>
	<p>Lord shiva lives in parandhamam that is christians says paralogam.we are all came from that parandhamam and earth is not our home planet.</p>
	<br />
	<p><b>Then who we are?</b></p>
	<p>we all are souls.we were came here to play our different roles in the drama(life).We entered into the body and controls this body.<i>we are in center of our eyebrows,thats why
we put bindi till now</i></p><center>
	<hr />
	<h3>THE FACT IS WE ARE SOULS BUT NOT THE BODY</h3>
	<hr /></center>
	</article>
	<artice>
	<h4>I caught one of your thought "<i>who told you like this:|?"</i></h4>
	<p>:) As we discussed earlier,shiva is lives in parandhamam.He is also a soul(supreme soul).He is the father for all souls.so he was also named as <b>
parampitha</b> or <b>paramatma</b></p>
	</article><center>
	<img src="images/appa.jpg"alt="paramatma"title="Our Father"width="600"height="300"></center>
	<article>
	<p>Muslims says ALLAH,cristians says PARAMPITHA,and hindus says SHIVA(shivaling).</p>
	<h3>There Is Only One God He Has Many Names.</h3>
	<p>That shiva comes to earth from parandhamam and enter into a OLD PEOPLE's body and teach as<b> who we are and what is our character</b>.and he named the old
people as BRAHMA.</p><center>
	<img src="images/brahmababa.jpg"alt="lord shiva enter into brahma's body"title="Brahma Baba"height="300"></center>
	</article>
	<article>
	<p>And he says the truth "we are all souls, not the body.Being in body conciousness make you do so many sins(<b>LUST,ANGER,ATTACHMENT,GREED,ARROGANCE.</b>).so <i>
please awake</i> you are souls who has the nature of LOVE,PEACE and HAPPINESS."he says</P>
	<h2>When Will Shiva Come?</h2>
	<h3><b>HE ALREADY CAME:))</b></h3>
	<p>Lord shiva came only at the time of kaliyugam end</p>
	<br />
	<p>Basically there are four yugas.They are <b>SATYUGA,TRETAYUGA,DVAPARAYUGA,and KALIYUGA</b> total 5000 years.</p><center>

	</article>
	<article>
	<p>Here the first 2500 years (satyuga and tretayuga)the earth was a heavenly planet and all living beings shows only love and remain in inner peace.Because they are
all in soul conciousness.<i>soul's original character is LOVE,HAPPINESS, and PEACE.</i></p>
	<p>Later in dvapara and kaliyugam we forgot we are souls,so we lost our happiness inside so we search for happiness outside so slowly we are in body conciousness
and do sins.On account of this we face so many worries,sadness.This is kaliyuga so we are in hell now.At the end of kaliyugam there is only sadness,At that time <b>lord will come</b></p>
	<p>He come at end of the kaliyugam(that is 100 years before kaliyuga's end).</p>
	<h2>WHY LORD SHIVA COME?</h2>
	<p>Actually this is a 5000 year old kaalachakra,He reveals a secret "what happened before 5000 years are happening now ,that is <b>If you reading this article
now ,you are also reading this before 5000 years</b>what happened is actually repeated every 5000 years".</p>
	<p>This is kaliyuga and it's going to end and satyuga have to come.so this old earth have to be destroy and new earth will come(ONLY PEOPLE WILL DIE NOT EARTH 
GET CRASHED).For that shiva(baba) came to earth and give knowledge about these.<b>only body get destroyed but soul doesn't destroyed ,soul is eternal</b></p>
	<p>Already it had been 85 years when baba came.</p>
	<p>In few years kaliyuga comes to end and satyuga going to start,so baba says</p>
	<br />
	<p><b>You all have a burden of bad karma.On account of this you are going to face so much sorrows in future.Already you are in sadness.If you want to escape 
from this you have to remember me as a"STAR IN ORANGE-GOLDEN SKY"(Parandhamam)</b></p>
	<p>And feel yourself as soul and come out from body conciousness</p>
	<br />
	<p>By the way of rememberance "your character will change and all of your sins get destroyed"and then at the time of kaliyuga end <b>I WILL TAKE YOU ALONG WITH ME TO OUR SWEET 
HOME PARANDHAMAM</B></P>
	<p>And we Again come to earth in satyugam and play our roles.This is the kaalachakra and every 5000 years was called 'one kalpha'</p>
	<p>so baba came at the end of kaliyuga and doing this GLORIOUS JOB.He came every 5000 years and <b>will come.</b></p>
	<hr />
	<p>In this kalpha shiva baba is already came.And speak everyday with us through old people and give knowledge.<i>The words delivered by him is called as <b>MURLI</b></i>
</p>
	<center><h2>Hear murli by</h2></center>
	<p>so what you have to do is <b>Wakeup in Amirtavela(3-4am)</b> and remember baba turns you into an angel.Those who learn baba's murli daily and in the remembrance of
Baba are definitly turns into an angel.Those angels are worshipped as vishnu,lakshmi,sankar,ganesha and so many.But these angels are you only!</p>
	<p>In satyugam starting there is nearly 9 lakhs of angels only and numberwise they will come to earth from paramdhamam and play their roles.in satyuga there
was only kingdom rule,At the end of satyuga,there is 50 or 60 crores citizens,But now there our population is more than 600 crores.Those who try will come satyuga
,others wont come they are go to parandhamam at the time of kaliyuga end,and come to earth only in dvapara or kaliyuga in next kalpha.</p>
	<p>If you are reading these till now definitly you are an angel soul because not everyone can understand these.</p>
	<p>keep trying hard in the practise of Being in soul-conciousness my <i>brothers and sisters</i> then you will surely get a king or queen post in satyuga:)</p>
