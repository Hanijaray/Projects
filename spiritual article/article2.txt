	<center><h1>Welcome Brothers/Sisters <3</h1>
	<h2>Let's see why we worship Lord shiva as shivling</h2></center>
	
	<p>When we say Lord shiva then suddenly what comes to our mind is a person with trisul,wearing snake and tiger skin etc...</p>
	<center><h2>Okay, why this person is worship as shivling?</h2></center>
	<p>Actually Lord shiva is a soul(<b> param aatma</b>), We are  also souls right? Not this body!</p>
	<p>Shiva is the Father of all souls.</p>
	<h2> Christians says God Father( param pitha) , Muslims says Allah (They says Allah is a point of light, that is nothing but The SUPREME SOUL.</h2>
	<p><b>THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD WHO HAS MANY NAMES</b>.</p>
	<p>Why we worship param aatma(shiva) as shivling mean ,Shiva devotees does poojas daily to God,They do abishekam,deepa aaratana etc...For that purpose
they build shivling by assuming the oval shape as soul.Actually souls(we) are a point of light our God is also a point of light, For pooja purpose they
build little large thats why we worship shiva as shivling</p><center>

	<center><h2> Then you have doubt like who is the one who wore snake, having damru ?</h2></center><center>
	<img src="image/sankar.jpg"alt="sankar"title="sankar"></center>
	<p> Actually this is sankar not shiva, why we call him as shiva mean, sankar was the severe devotee of Lord shiva ,so they considered wrongly as this is shiva 
</p>
	<p><b> Just think  if sankar is The God then who he will remember while he is in a meditation, He is always in a meditation right? For doing meditation we have
to remember God right? so sankar remember Lord shiva as a point of light(soul) and do rajayoga.We wrongly considered sankar as shivling</b></p>
	<p> Likewise sankar we are also have to remember God as Point of light in a golden-orange sky( Parandhamam - This is the place where God live )By doing that 
we are able to remain in SOUL CONCIOUSNESS , By remaining in soul consiousness we dont do sins( <b> Lust, Anger, Attachment, Greed, Arrogance</b>)<p>
	<p>We are in kaliyug ,this is the place of sorrow, God give this knowledge to his sweet children to get rid from sorrow</p>
	<p> By remembering God as Soul we can get rid from  kaliyug and will go to mukthi dham and Enter into the NEXT UPCOMING SATYUG</p>
